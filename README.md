## About this project

This project is a simple browser for files on your server. A coworker of mine was missing a feature to browse files on
his server, running a Spring Boot application. He wanted something like the standard Apache browser, so I thought I'll
give it a shot.

This project is provided via the MIT-licence, which is free of charge. This is a work-in-progress and done in my spare
time.

## How it works

The project is a spring boot project, so it works as a jar file as well as deployed to a tomcat/websphere/glassfish/etc
application server. You are also welcomed to integrate it into your application. Take whatever you need from this
project. Source code, templates, ideas, you name it
